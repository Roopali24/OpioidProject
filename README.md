Regarding paper "Keeping Homeless Youth off Opioids: Optimizing Intervention Delivery using Causal Inference"

File (OpioidProject.R) has all the code required to:
1. Impute missing data using mice.
2. Run BART, DT and LASSO regression on the modified imputed data.
3. Make 95% CI for causal inference for each pair of interventions.

Some modifications to the data were done in excel.
